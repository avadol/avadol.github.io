<h1> Little Prince</h1>
<body>
<div>
<p> As the little prince dropped off to sleep, I took him in my arms and set out walking once more.
<span class="group_1" >"I felt deeply moved, and stirred. It seemed to me that I was carrying
    a very fragile treasure.</span>
    <span id="highlight">It seemed to me, even, that there
        was nothing more fragile on all Earth.</span>
In the moonlight I looked at his pale forehead,
his closed eyes, his locks of hair that trembled in the wind, and I said to myself:
    <span class="group_2">"What I see here is nothing but a shell. What is most important is invisible...‚Äù</span>
    As his lips opened slightly with the suspicion of a half-smile, I said to myself, again:
    <span class="group_2"> What moves me so deeply, about this little prince who is sleeping here, is his loyalty to
    a flower--the image of a rose that shines through his whole being like the flame of the lamp,
    even when he is asleep..." </span> And I felt him to be more fragile still.
    <span class="group_1">I felt the need of
    protecting him, as if he himself were a flame that might be extinguished by a little puff
          of wind...</span>
