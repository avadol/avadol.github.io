<div style="width:400px">

    Hello, My name is Ahmed Vadol, I was born and raised half of my life in Sudan.
    I have moved to the United States at the age of 12, soon after I began my education
    here in the US. <u>I had difficulty learning in school due to language barrier</u>,
    <i>in Sudan our primary language is Arabic.</i> That was twelve years ago,
    <b>you see now I have come a long way</b>. I have participated in many different
    sports during high school, <mark>I played soccer, <sub>wrestling and basketball</sub>,
    i may not have been the best</mark>, but I really enjoyed sports.
